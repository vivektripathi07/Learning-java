## Overview

This is a repo where I'll be building java projects for learning purposes.

Most of the project here would be from [Coding Challanges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) by Jhon Crickett.

I'll list them downn in the order I do them.



## Project Details:

##### 1. [Gradle Basics](gradle_tut) :
This is pretty straight-forward I learnt how to work with gradle. Learnt about basic tasks and how to use <u>build.gradle.kts file</u>.

##### 2. [WC tool](WC_tool):
This is simple project where I have build a command line tool which takes a text file as a parameter and some other optional parameter and returns the word count, line count or byte count using command prompt. (If none of the optional parameter is given it returns all 3 counts.)

###### Approach:
Use java file handling for inputting the file and basic if else condition for checking the String arguments given while runnning the jar file.

Then use .bat file for shortening the file path.

Finally update the directory path in the environment variable for running it from the command prompt.
